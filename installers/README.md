# Installing
To install note on your computer, all you have to do is obtain the executable 
and make sure you have access to it globaly and that the executable supports your operating system. Note current only
has working installers for Arch Linux and Ubunut **(Not sure about debian as a whole, ubuntu installer might also work for other debian based installations)**
if you don't happen to be using a distro of Arch Linux or Ubuntu you might have to download the source and compile it. 
# Using the Installers
To use the Arch installer just paste this command into your terminal
```
touch arc.sh && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awesome-Sauces/Note/main/installers/arch.sh > arc.sh && sh arc.sh
```
To use the Ubuntu installer paste this command into your terminal
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awesome-Sauces/Note/main/installers/ubuntu.sh && sh ubuntu.sh
```
You can also download the file itself then run it if you would wish to do that.
# MacOS
MacOS is fully supported and an executable compiled on an M1 chip is attached to the 1.2.2 Release and will be with
all future releases. To use it you just have to obtain the executable and let be accessible globally or locally if you wish
# Windows
Windows is not tested, but I'm sure if compiled from source it should work but might have some bugs
