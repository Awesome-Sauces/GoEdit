# Note

Note is terminal text editor, originally made with a tui library called [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview/). But now centered more towards [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell).
I am currently refactoring the whole code base. I am also changing the versioning. The previous version was 1.2.2 but Note will now be moved to v0.0.1 but as development continues it should
reach a stable release soon enough. Therefore, as soon as this branch contains a version that is stable and won't result in losing complete file contents it will be merged to main.

Also a new logo has been created, using inkscape, with a style similar to that of VIM.
