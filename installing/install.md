# Installing

Installing Note is a really easy task to do!
I made a quick little script to install the latest version of Note for anyone who wishes to use note but doesn't know how to install with source code!
First off to start you are going to want to run these commands in your terminal
```touch installer.sh```
Replace the raw file with your Linux Operating system.
For this example we will use the ArchLinux Installer
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awesome-Sauces/Note/Note-v1.0.0-BETA/installing/ArchLinuxInstaller.sh > installer.sh```
 Run this to allow executing file as program
```sudo chmod u+x installer.sh```

After you are done running these commands in your terminal of choice, just run this final command.
```./installer.sh```
Finally after all this hard work, you have succesfully installed Note!
Although when running the final command it will ask for your password.
