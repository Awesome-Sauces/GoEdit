Installing Note is a really easy task to do!
I made a quick little script to install the latest version of Note for anyone who wishes to use note but doesn't know how to install with source code!
First off to start you are going to want to run these commands in your terminal

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awesome-Sauces/Note/main/help/installing/resources/ArchInstaller.sh > ArchInstaller.sh

For Ubuntu do this

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awesome-Sauces/Note/main/help/installing/resources/DebianInstaller.sh

Replace the raw file link with your Linux Operating system Installer.
For this example we will use the ArchLinux Installer,
run this to allow executing file as program

    sudo chmod u+x ArchInstaller.sh

After you are done running these commands in your terminal of choice, just run this final command.
```
./ArchInstaller.sh
```
Finally after all this hard work, you have succesfully installed Note!
**Although when running the final command it will ask for your password.**

# Alternative Methods
___

The second way to installing Note is to download the .sh installer named after your Linux Distro!
in this case you would only have to run this two commands

    sudo chmod u+x ArchInstaller.sh
    ./ArchInstaller.sh
___

The third way is to build from source, I'm guessing if your doing this then you know how too!

## Great!
Now you have successfully installed the newest version of note!
